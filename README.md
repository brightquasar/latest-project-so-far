This is what I have so far. Still working on the adding of the image taken with the camera to the Person class.
I have, in this version, added some extra stuff, the Namath person with no first name I intend to make into a game so the user can guess the famous person's name and then be told if they guessed correctly. If 
you want to give me some hints of how to add the image taken with the camera to the Person class, that would 
be awesome:]
